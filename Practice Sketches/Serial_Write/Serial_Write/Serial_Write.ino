  "SERIAL COMMS INTRO - BASIC UART"

  - DEMO FOR SENDING SERIAL DATA FROM ARDUINO TO P5.JS
  - READS ANALOG SENSOR AND WRITES 8-BIT VALUE TO SERIAL PORT
  - IMPLEMENTS REPEATING SOFTWARE TIMER TO STABILIZE SERIAL COMMS

  NOTE:
  - You must DISCONNECT (or exit) p5.serialcontrol Sketch before uploading to MCU.
  - Otherwise, the UART port used for code upload will be blocked by UART comms to P5.
